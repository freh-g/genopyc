Genopyc is a Python  library for investigating the effect of genetic variants on the downstream pathways. It allows to perform various tasks such as retrieve the functional elements neighbouring genomic coordinates, investigating linkage disequilibrium (LD), annotate variants, retrieving genes affected by non coding variants and perform and visualize functional enrichment analysis.  


To learn more on an application of genopyc library to investigate variants related to Intervertebral Disc Degeneration refer to the [tutorial](https://github.com/freh-g/genopyc/blob/main/tutorials/Genopyc_tutorial_notebook.ipynb).


The [documentation](https://genopyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is available at readthedocs.
